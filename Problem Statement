You need to implement the R-tree data structure (1984 Guttman paper) using the CBS algorithm for node splits explained in the "2014 - Corner..." paper attached. Implement all its operations as explained in the paper. Build the structure over the dataset given in data.txt. This consists of 21 two-dimensional data points, one point per line. You can choose m=2 and M=4. You don't need to implement deletion operation. If there is any another parameter in the paper, choose is as per the recommendations of the paper or make an appropriate choice.

Then implement a pre order traveral of the tree you have build which prints the MBR values (top right point and bottom left point of the MBR being printed) for each internal node traversed, and prints the 2-D objects stored in them while traversing the leaf nodes. Clear distinction is to be made while printing, whether the node you are printing is internal node or external node.
